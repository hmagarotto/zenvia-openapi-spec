The RCS channel may be used after it's activation on Zenvia Platform.
Get in touch with Zenvia consultants to create your Google agent (An agent is a conversational entity that interacts with users by sending messages and reacting to users' responses).

## Limitations

When you send some message for one contact using RCS channel:

Recipient: is the phone number of contact
Sender: is the RCS Agent ID (an email created and linked with a Zenvia's OrgID)

When you receive a message from one contact, the sender and recipient is inverted:

Recipient: is the RCS Agent ID
Sender: is the phone number of contact

In API the sender is the field from and the receiver is the field to of message object.
